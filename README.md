  1. (In CLI or code editor e.g. Visual Studio Code), go to (i.e. cd for Windows) project directory, run "py -m venv env"
  2. In project directory, run ".\env\Scripts\activate"
  3. Install modules using pip/pip3
  4. Run "deactivate" to leave virtual environment

**Set and See Environment Variables in Windows**

**Containerize (a.k.a. Create Docker image), Upload image to Container Registry, Deploy to Cloud Run** (https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cloud-run-hello-python3#4, https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-deploy-docker-containers-to-the-cloud-b4d89b2c6c31 app.py deploy failed but consider Dockerfile line "RUN pip install -r requirements.txt" which iterates through requirements.txt to install modules)<br>
1. In project directory, create app.py and Dockerfile (and requirements.txt if needed)
2. In project directory, run "gcloud auth login" and log into Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using web browswer
3. *Containerize and Upload image to Container Registry*: In project directory, run "gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/%PROJECT_ID%/%PROJECT_NAME%", variables are:
  - set PROJECT_ID=string...ID generated by GCP for your project (usually project_name-number_sequence)
  - set PROJECT_NAME=string...name of your choice (usually project name)
  - set DOCKER_IMG=gcr.io/%PROJECT_ID%/%PROJECT_NAME%
and confirm that image successfully created with STATUS "SUCCESS"<br>
4. *Deploy to Cloud Run*: In project directory, run "gcloud run deploy %PROJECT_NAME% --image %DOCKER_IMG% --platform managed --region %REGION% --allow-unauthenticated", variables are:
  - REGION="string"...usually "us-central1"<br>

*Variables Setup in Windows Powershell, for personal use:* set PROJECT_ID=hello-315713<br>
set PROJECT_NAME=pyglot<br>
set DOCKER_IMG=gcr.io/%PROJECT_ID%/%PROJECT_NAME%<br>
set REGION="us-central1"
